# Flow-field 

This code is based on the concept of vector field.
In calculus and physics, a vector field is an assignment of a vector to each point in a subset of space. A vector field in the plane, can be visualised as: a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction, each attached to a point in the plane.

In this demo imaginary particles are poured on to that vector field and the field is changing constantly with time.
